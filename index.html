<p>aaaaaaa it's half past five in the morning I have no idea so what I'm doing</p>

<h3>Alright let's get some descriptions up in this bitch.</h3>

<!-- is swearing okay in coding? -->

<p>I'm noooone, which is a name based on my online roleplaying alias Nina Noone. My real name is Mikael Akalla, and I am an eighteen year old student living in Stockholm, Sweden. </p>

<p>I suffer from depression, pectus excavatum, addiction to computer and a penis.</p>

<!-- Penis mentioned, swearing now officially okay -->

<p>I am born a guy, but I look very feminine with long hair and slim form.</p>

<h4>Goals and dreams:</h4>

<p>Capturing the souls of everyone in my proximity *cough* okay no I want to either be a programmer or a writer. I'm only eighteen, but I've discovered that my talent is writing a ton of text, whether it be a story or code.</p>

<h4>Educationism</h4>

<p>So far, I've got (soon) three years of what you guys would call high school education aimed at programming. I will finish high school this summer, after which I'm going to attempt to get a job.</p>

<p>As for my grades, I managed to get an A in programming in the second year (which is actually better than an A in the american grading system because sweden is like that), but I almost failed the English course. You can tell I'm bad at English, yes? (Sarcasm.)</p>

<h4>Stuff</h4>

<p>You can find my own website that I have hosted on a server together with a few friends on <a href="http://fallemmc.com/mikael" target="_new">fallemmc.com/mikael</a>. If you check on the 'links' page on that site, you can see a bunch of JavaScript projects I've worked on for the past three years, but it's not the only projects I've done, just the ones that could easily be put on the web.</p>
